  <h1>HAME R1 router WIFI password</h1>

<p>Recently picked up - HAME R1 Portable 4400mAh Battery Powered 3G - off <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XHAME+R1+router&amp;_nkw=HAME+R1+router&amp;_sacat=0">ebay</a>. The item is advertised as <em>Wireless Router WIFI Router R1 3 in 1</em>. As it happens, the seller repackages the item so that they can ship more like a gift than a purchased product. Which is thoughtful but can end up forgetting a few things. In my case, the HAME comes with individual default password just below the default SSID at the back of the device.</p>

<p>Mine wasn&#39;t there. <a href="http://www.hametech.com/html/product/">Hametech</a>, the english website of the manufacturer is most useless as the support pages are long dead... Frustrated by the seller (By now, 4 messages sent to the seller via Skype, Ebay and Email) and now by the manufacturer; I resorted to youtube to see if I can find any HAME unboxings that will help or someone with such a problem in the comments section. Bupkis.</p>

<p>Hmmm, but as I was watching the videos, I made an observation regarding the WIFI passsword, there was a pattern. I picked up a similarity on the initial characters as they typed the password. The first 3 characters were always the same i.e. started with 7c3. The default password uses WPA encryption so the password has to have a minimum of 8 characters.</p>

<p>I also made a visual connection between the default SSID written at the back of the device as they typed. Hame SSID is in the format <strong>HAME<em>R1</em>xxxx</strong> with <strong>xxxx</strong> being the unique set of characters with each device. So if your device had SSID <strong>HAME<em>R1</em>x123</strong>, then you extract the characters after the last underscore and append them to 7c3. You end up with <strong>7c3x123</strong></p>

<p>You still won&#39;t be able to connect as most devices validate password to meet the minimum no. of characters before allowing you to connect at all. I went back to two of the videos I had watched and as fate would have it, they both ended with 8 as the final character of the WIFI password.</p>

<p>So your working password (based on the above deductions) should be <strong>7c3x1238</strong></p>

<p>If you stare at the format a for minute and analyse it. There are 7 characters before the last one. The last character is a number 8, the first is 7. The third character is always 3. The second is always c.</p>
